## How To Build
### Mac OS
This project uses SDL as the main windowing system and as a renderer. You can install it from https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.
* Once this is installed create a folder "deps" at the root of the project.
* Create the following directories inside "deps": include/SDL2.
* Place the SDL2 headers inside "deps/include/SDL2".
    * Alternatively, you can change line 14 in the .vscode/tasks.json file to point to your own SDL2 installation .
* You can then build the project using VS Code. (cmd + shift + B)
